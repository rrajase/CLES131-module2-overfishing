## Rubric

### Use of GitHub (3 points)
 - 0 points for no forked repo or a repo with no unique commits
 - 1 point for at least 1 commit or commits by only one partner or README that has not been updated
 - 2 points for semi-regular commits or partially updated README
 - 3 points for regular commits by both partners and a fully updated README
 
### Quarto (2 points)
 - 0 points for no .qmd file or wholly incorrect formatting
 - 1 point for mostly correct code and text, but not all file paths or plots are working so the pdf is incompletely rendered
 - 2 points for well-formatted file that fully renders to pdf

### Code and written analysis (10 points)
See .qmd file for point distributions. 
Full points will be given for insightful written analysis and successful code that uses tidyverse syntax and is highly readable. 
Consult the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for formatting examples.
